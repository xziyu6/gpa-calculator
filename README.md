# GPA-Calculator
Calculator for SHSID high school GPA model

I used this as practice while I learned Python, so it will include dumb code in early versions

Examples of input and output are in "GPA info.xlsx" and "GPA output.txt". Should be self-explanatory

Dependencies: pandas, numpy, tkinter

2025/11/21: I decided to refine some documentation and change the license to MIT. I have stopped updating this project some time ago, but just picked it up and wanted to officially archive this project which supported my first years learning programming.
